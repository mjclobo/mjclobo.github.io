I’m a PhD student with a strong interest in
studying how to better describe and model the earth system.
My focus is on ocean physics and ocean/climate modeling, though
I have a strong drive to develop and expand my knowledge in all adjacent
subjects such as atmospheric physics, air-sea interactions, general applied
mathematics, and much more.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy reading literature, admiring and exploring our
beautiful natural world, and spending with my dog, Cauchy, and cat, Ashley.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my page!</p>]]></content><author><name>Matt Lobo</name></author><category term="Intro" /><category term="hello" /><category term="oceanography" /><category term="physics" /><category term="fourth" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
