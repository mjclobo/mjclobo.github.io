excerpt: 'Communicating science to a broad and diverse audience, and increasing upward mobility
			for people from underrepresented backgrounds, are two goals which motivate me greatly.
			By increasing science literacy we can help empower people to make choices that lead to
			the preservation of beautiful places and their natural residents, such as the elk of
			Tonquin Valley in Jasper National Park; shown here during a 2018 backpacking trip.'

## My diversity/outreach philosophy
I believe that having a more diverse population represented in STEM fields
leads to greater innovation and an accelerated rate of progress.
In my mind, the term diversity encompasses socioeconomic background, race, ethnicity,
gender identity, age, ability, religion, and any other way in which a person might identify
as being different from their peers.
I feel extremely privileged to grow as a physical oceanographer at Princeton University, and I never thought that
I would have this amazing opportunity.
A strong and persistent aim of mine is to help others from underrepresented backgrounds
make their way into the world of STEM, and to more generally promote upward mobility
for all.


## Outreach events in the past
A group of AOS students/scientists in Princeton and I prioritize remaining engaged
with our New Jersey community.
Here we (myself, Gabe, and Winnie) are using the [rotating tank setup](https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/#diy-rotating-tank)
which I built for outreach and scientific demonstration, during the Spring Into Science outreach event
which was attended by over 300 people!
By video calling the phone that co-rotates with the tank, people are able to
see our model ocean/atmosphere from both rotating and non-rotating points of view.

Here I'm leading a group of kids in an experiment demonstrating
how carbon dioxide leads to ocean acidification, at the 2023 NJ Fun Days event in Sandy Hook.

## Outreach events in the future
If you're part of an organization that is interested in
hosting a group of atmosphere/ocean scientists to give a talk and provide demos related
to climate science, then please reach out!
We have presentations and demonstrations with varying levels of
participation and ``science'' that can be made suitable for a wide range
of students based on age, knowledge, and interest.


## Princeton AOS Applicant Mentorship Program (AMP)
I am the initiator and lead organizer of the
[Princeton AOS Applicant Mentorship Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bQ5t6RfVNGbuvoCEEOBeC2n9gDCuvR9CGK9l3dMXUo/edit),
a program that pairs Princeton AOS applicants with current students/postdocs, in order to support them through the
application process.
If you're considering applying to our program and would like access to the wealth of knowledge
of the current student body, please fill out the application form, found on the
[AOS Prospective Students](https://aos.princeton.edu/phd_program/prospective-students) page.

Though one goal of this program is to increase the diversity of the Princeton AOS student body,
students from all backgrounds are encouraged to participate!


## Future collaborators
If you're a fellow scientist interested in beginning outreach in your
community, or you're curious about any of the experiments shown here,
feel free to drop me a line.
