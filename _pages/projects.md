## Shallow water tide model with self-attraction and loading

I made a linear, single-layer, viscous, non-rotating
shallow water model with tidal and wind forcing to explore
using different predictor and predictor-corrector schemes
when applying self-attraction and loading (SAL) forcing
in an ocean model.
The code for the model can be found in a Github repository
[here](https://github.com/mjclobo/swTideModel).

Note that there is an animation below which currently doesn't
appear in Firefox browsers.
