<p>Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Princeton Universityâ€™s <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program</a> where I study and perform research in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also (will) have various <a href="https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/">projects</a> which highlight my personal and professional interests.</p>

<h2 id="outreach">Outreach</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m always interested in helping others make their way into the field of ocean sciences, and STEM more generally.
If you are looking for any advice for gaining research experience, applying to graduate school, or just want general
information, feel free to contact me.</p>
