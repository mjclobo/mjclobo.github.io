I"i<p>Hello! I’m a PhD student with a strong interest in
studying how to better describe and model the earth system.
My focus is on ocean physics and ocean/climate modeling, though
I have a strong drive to develop and expand my knowledge in all adjacent
subjects such as atmospheric physics, air-sea interactions, general applied
mathematics, and much more.</p>
