I"ˆ<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Princeton Universityâ€™s <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program</a> where I study and perform research in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics.
My research focuses on ocean physics and ocean/climate modeling where I uses a vast skillset spanning the subjects of vector calculus, signal processing,
fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, computer programming, and general applied and computational mathematics.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also (will) have various <a href="https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/">projects</a> which highlight my personal and professional interests.</p>

<h2 id="outreach">Outreach</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m always open to outreach opportunities, especially those that
are geared towards making STEM more accessible to people from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also interested in helping others make their way into the field of ocean sciences and STEM, more generally.
If youâ€™re looking for any advice on gaining research experience, applying to graduate school, or just want general
information, feel free to contact me.</p>
