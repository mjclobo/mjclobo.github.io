# About me

I'm currently a PhD student in Princeton University's [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/) where I study and perform research in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics.

---

I also (will) have various [projects](https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/) which highlight my personal and professional interests.

## Outreach

I'm always open to outreach opportunities, especially those that
are geared towards making STEM more accessible to people from underrepresented backgrounds.

I'm also interested in helping others make their way into the field of ocean sciences and STEM, more generally.
If you're looking for any advice on gaining research experience, applying to graduate school, or just want general
information, feel free to contact me.
