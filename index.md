# About me

I'm a PhD student in Princeton University's
[Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/),
where I study and perform research in the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics
under the guidance of [Dr. Stephen Griffies](https://stephengriffies.github.io/).
My research focuses on ocean physics and ocean/climate modeling, with the overarching goal
of better physically understanding the oceans and being able to represent them
in numerical models of varying complexity.

I also (will) have various [projects](https://mjclobo.github.io/projects/) which highlight my personal and professional interests.

## Outreach

I'm always looking for outreach opportunities, especially those that
are geared towards making STEM more accessible to people from underrepresented backgrounds.

I'm also interested in helping others make their way into the field of ocean sciences and STEM, more generally.
If you're looking for any advice on gaining research experience, applying to graduate school, or just want general
information, feel free to contact me.
